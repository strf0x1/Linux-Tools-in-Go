## containers in go

This is a simple pseudo-docker clone based on the talk by Liz Rice - Containers From Scratch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fi7uSYlOdc

It works similar to docker run: go run main.go run image <cmd> <params>

Also implemented the user namespace code listed in this presentation: https://speakerdeck.com/lizrice/rootless-containers-from-scratch
